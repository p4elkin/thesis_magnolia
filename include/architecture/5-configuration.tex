\section{Configuration in Magnolia CMS}
By means of the \emp{Location Framework} and \emph{MVP} pattern which were
described before we have defined a foundation for a loosely coupled system.
In order to add a new functional component in such a system would only require
to implement its logic and to add the proper mapping, so the system would load
the component on demand. In the current section we will analyze the methods of  

Configuration mechanism is an essential feature of many software products. It
enhances the flexibility and extensibility in the sense that the person without
deep knowledge of the system internals can alter its behavior, re-arrange and
customize its parts. Magnolia CMS is also configurable.
Most of configurations are kept within \emph{config} workspace. There are
several techniques in Magnolia CMS that are used for applying the configuration.
The main two concepts are \emph{observation} and \emph{Node2Bean}.

\paragraph{Observation} is a feature of JCR that allows for subscribing to the
changes in a workspace. Observing applications can monitor and react on those
changes whenever the persistent operation is made in JCR. This feature has found
various ways of applications in Magnolia CMS. For instance, one of the most
important ways is the foundation for the factory-based [TODO: consider factory
appendix] structures: some sort of bindings are stored in a workspace in a form
of the registry which is later used in the factory to produce the actual objects.

\paragraph{Node2Bean} is used to convert the JCR nodes into the Java objects. 

By means of Java Reflection (introspection mechanism) Node2Bean binds the the
fields of a Java Bean to the corresponding configuration properties (if such are
available) through the bean's "setter" and "adder" methods. Node2Bean can
support all possible data types:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple data types like \texttt{String, int, long, float, double, boolean}.
  \item Collections with String values or other data types by specifying a class property.
  \item Maps with keys and values as Strings or other data types by specifying a class property.
  \item Complex classes can be mapped with Node2Bean by means of the sub-nodes
  which follow the same rules and restrictions.
\end{itemize}

Let us consider an example of using Node2Bean:

Numbered items:

\begin{itemize}
  \item config: Entry point of the transformation. In the module descriptor
  \texttt{SampleConfig} class is used. Set text and number properties.
  \item sub: Sub bean. The class is determined using reflection if it is not
  explicitly defined.
  \item items: Collection. The corresponding add method is used to determine the
  class and populate the collection if existing.
  \item item2: Special item with its own class and additional properties.
  \item parameters: Collection of key-value pairs.
\end{itemize}
