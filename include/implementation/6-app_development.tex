\section{App Example}
In order to analyze the quality and efficiency of the Magnolia 5.0 AdminCentral
design, we will develop a custom app. If there are potential problems in the
system architecture, such an excercise is probably the only way to reveal them.
A good candidate for an app concept is integration of Google Analytics in
Magnolia 5.0.
First of all, we will try to re-use the \texttt{ContentApp} structure for our
app in order to examine its usefulness.  Another task of the excercise will be
integration with an exernal service which is supposed to prove the flexibility
and extensibility of the system.
